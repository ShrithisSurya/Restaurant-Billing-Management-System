Restaurant Billing Management System
This project is a restaurant billing management system developed with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Python, PyCharm, and MySQL for the database. It enables restaurant staff to easily manage customer orders and generate accurate bills.

Project Overview
1.Project Setup:
I developed this project in PyCharm, utilizing Python for logic and a MySQL database to store restaurant data.

2.GUI Design:
The system features a user-friendly GUI created using a Python library (like Tkinter or PyQt). The interface allows users to input customer orders, view prices, and generate bills.

3.Database Integration:
The project is connected to a MySQL database named restaurant_billing. This database stores menu items, prices, and other related details required for billing.

4.CSV File Handling:
CSV files have been inserted into the Python code to streamline data input and storage. This feature allows bulk data insertion into the database, making it easier to manage menu items or order history and i inserted to the csv file also in my repository.

5.Billing Logic:
The system calculates the total bill by fetching menu prices from the database, multiplying the price by the quantity ordered, and applying any additional charges or discounts as needed.

6.Bill Generation:
The system generates a detailed bill, showing the itemized list of ordered items, quantities, and the total payable amount. This bill is displayed on the GUI.

7.Project Status:
The project is currently running smoothly. I have yet to perform thorough testing and debugging, though no major issues have been encountered so far.
